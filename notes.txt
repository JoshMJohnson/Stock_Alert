Bugs:
- Toggling ticker symbols on watchlist doesn't turn off request for that entity yet
    - Stop api get request
    - Ignore on notification description
- Ticker page market logo responsive (example: NASDAQ, NYSE)
- Database interations (check Stock Tracker repo file for error numbers; verify with Postman)
    - Adding stocks not found on stock market
    - Adding stocks past the 8 GET request limit per minute by Twelve Data API
- Last Updated feature only refreshes on application initial load.
    - needs to update text display on trigger if app is open in the background
    
To Do:
- Turn off battery optimization for foreground service delay prevention
- Handle font scaling
- Create notifications when save pressed within Settings page
- Handle foreground service on save pressed within Settings page
    - Start service
    - Terminate service
- Handle twelve data api errors (shown on documentation)
    
Feature Additions:
- Possibly use http flutter request to access stock tickers directly somehow
    - Allows app to go on app store
- Include industries that the ticker company is involved in on the Ticker page
- Implement an first time app use intro directions
    - use flutter name: IntroductionScreen
- API get request for logo on adding symbol to watchlist
    - Possibly request after market is closed
        - loop through watchlist and if no image; call api get request for it
