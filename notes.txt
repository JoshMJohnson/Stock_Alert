- Ticker page market logo responsive (example: NASDAQ, NYSE)
- Database interations (check Stock Tracker repo file for error numbers; verify with Postman)
    - Adding stocks already on watchlist
    - Adding stocks not found on stock market
    - Removing stocks not on watchlist
    - Adding stocks past the 8 GET request limit per minute by Twelve Data API
